# graphtype

A small backend project using TypeORM with Apollo-server, focusing on:

- integrating TypeORM with TypeGraphQL
- cursor pagination in Apollo
- caching in Apollo
- redis-based auth
- data loader

This is a follow-up after completing Ben Awad's Full stack tutorial (completed in my 'Ahab' repos) to get a little more practice in some of these areas
